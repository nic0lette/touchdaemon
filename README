EDIT: This is a fork of http://sourceforge.net/projects/touchdaemon/
I haven't cleaned up the code yet, or updated this file. Sorry. Soon(tm).

### MAIN CODE

compilation: g++ -lX11 -lXi touchdaemon.c -o name

./name '-c<command>' the quotas are against spaces and doublequotes in the command
example:
./name '-cxinput set-prop "Logitech USB Gaming Mouse" "Device Enabled"'

You get the xinput string by tipping "xinput list", picking out your touchpad name and replace my "Logitech USB Gaming Mouse".

See the help options to get more functionalities. XRecod ( -R) is deactivated.
To press one key for more than a second sets the touchpad to enabled.


### TOOLS:

There is a script from Hielos to alternate the touchpad status on demand
